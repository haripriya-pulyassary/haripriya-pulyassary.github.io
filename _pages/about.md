I am a third-year PhD student in the School of Operations Research and Information Engineering at Cornell University, advised by Professor [David Shmoys](https://people.orie.cornell.edu/shmoys/) and Professor [Manxi Wu](https://sites.google.com/view/manxi-wu/home). Prior to joining Cornell, I completed my M.Math in Combinatorics & Optimization at the University of Waterloo, under the supervision of Professor [Chaitanya Swamy](https://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/~cswamy/). I also obtained my Bachelors in Computer Science from the University of Waterloo. 

For research, I mostly think about problems arising in discrete optimization and game theory. In particular, I am interested in the design of optimization methods and incentive mechanisms to improve the sustainability of transportation and logistics networks, particularly in the context of heavy-duty electric vehicles.
